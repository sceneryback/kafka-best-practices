# kafka-best-practices

This repo discusses some techniques of consuming kafka (Sync, Batch, MultiAsync and MultiBatch) and try to demonstrate some best practices which I think would be generally useful to consume data efficiently.

* Sync

consume messages one by one

* Batch

consume messages batch by batch

* MultiAsync

the "Fan In / Fan Out" pattern

* MultiBatch

the "Fan In / Fan Out" pattern batch by batch
